ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Manya, a self-starting and resourceful full-stack Web Developer currently working as a Software Development Engineer at Paytm. With extensive experience in JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and the React framework, I have successfully implemented both front-end and back-end coding solutions.

I specialize in designing intuitive user interactions and creating robust, easy-to-use databases. As an astute and continuously learning designer, I pride myself on my ability to solve complex problems and apply data-driven concepts effectively.

I am passionate about taking on full-stack web development projects to further hone my skills and gain real-world experience. My goal is to build interactive, user-friendly websites and applications that make a meaningful impact.
